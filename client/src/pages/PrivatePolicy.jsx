        <p className="font-bold pt-5">1c. What company owns SLVL?</p>
        <p>
          SLVL Europe Limited is an Irish limited liability company with
          registration number 551873 and a registered office at 6th Floor, South
          Bank House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold pt-5">1d. What privacy law applies to SLVL?</p>
        <p>
          SLVL controls the personal information you supply to us through our
          Services in accordance with the laws of the country in which you
          reside, which means that not all elements of this policy will apply to
          you depending on where you live.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold pt-5">
          1e. How old do I have to be to consent to you using my data?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&apos;re under the age of 13, you can&apos;t use ASKfm. You can
          enable us to use your data in almost all countries if you are 13 or
          older. <br />
          However, because European law has changed, we must obtain your
          parent&apos;s or guardian&apos;s approval before allowing you to
          register an account if you are between the ages of 13 and 16. <br />
          This is known as the &quot;age of consent,&quot; and it means that we
          must obtain parental consent if you are under a specific age. The age
          varies per country in Europe, therefore it is dependent on where you
          live.
