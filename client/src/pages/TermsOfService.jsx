        <p className="font-bold">1a. What are these Terms of Service?</p>
        <p>
          These terms (&quot;TOS") are part of the legal papers that
          regulate your access to and use of SLVL, whether you use the website
          or the mobile apps (the “Services”).
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold pt-5">1b. Why are these TOU important?</p>
        <p>
          You agree to be governed by the terms and conditions of these TOS, as
          well as the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, which are incorporated
          herein by reference, by accessing, using, registering for, or
          receiving any of the Services. Because these terms form a legally
          binding relationship between you as a user of the Services and SLVL
          Philippines Limited (&quot;SLVL&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;
          or &quot;us&quot;), you must read them before using or using the
          Services.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold pt-5">
          1c. Do I need my parents&apos; consent to sign up or to use SLVL?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a minor, you must have your parents&apos; or
          guardians&apos; consent to enter into these TOU and use the Services,
          and by using the Services, you agree that you have received that
          consent.

        <p className="font-bold">2a. How old do I need to be?</p>
        <p>
          By accessing or using the Services, you represent and warrant that you
          are at least 13 years old (or the age of legal majority in your
          country, if higher), and that you are fully capable of entering into
          and complying with these TOS.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold pt-5">2b. What if I am under 13?</p>
        <p>
          If you are under the age of 13, you will not be able to use SLVL. You
          must be at least 13 years old to access or use the Services. If we
          discover that you are under the age of 13 and are not entitled to use
          the Services, we will cancel your account and endeavor to prevent you
          from using the Services.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold pt-5">2c. What laws do I need to follow?</p>
        <p>
          When you access and use the Services, you are responsible for ensuring
          that you follow all applicable laws and regulations in your home
          country. By using the Services, you certify that you have not been
          convicted of, and are not under any court order relating to, assault,
          violence, sexual misconduct, or harassment.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold pt-5">
          2d. Do you do any background or criminal checks?
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not perform any criminal or other background checks on our
          users. When engaging with other individuals on the internet, you
          should use caution, as detailed in our Safety Center.
